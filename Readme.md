## FACE DETECTION ðŸ˜Ž ##

In this project we have to detect the multiple faces using OpenCV, Flask, Socketio & Mediapipe with acurracy more than 90%.<br> <br>
With the help of Mediapipe, we have to made the frames which was captured using OpenCV on WebCam then rendered it using Flask and finally gives the output. <br>
For Uploading on Heroku, we need Socket.io and base64 . 

We deployed it on Heroku. Click [Here](https://face1-detection.herokuapp.com/) for Live Experience.
